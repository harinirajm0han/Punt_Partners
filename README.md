We’ve created a text editor with dynamic font customization features. 
The HTML includes dropdowns for selecting font families, weights, and variants. 
The JavaScript dynamically fetches font data from the Google Fonts API, populating the font selectors based on available fonts and weights. 
It handles font changes, including selecting the closest variant if the exact match isn’t available. 
Local storage is used to persist text content, font settings, and color choices between sessions. 
Reset and save buttons allow users to reset the editor to default settings or save their customizations. 
CSS styles enhance the editor’s appearance, making it more aesthetic with improved button styles, color pickers, and responsive design. 
Overall, this setup provides a fully functional and customizable text editor with a user-friendly interface.
